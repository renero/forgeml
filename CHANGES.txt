0.2.0a
------
- ProgressBar has been updated to refresh more accurately the progress of the entire set of nested pipelines. The API changed a little bit (different progbars are now referenced by their names instead of "ids". Whenever you call "update" you must provide the number of steps from the beginning, not the advance.

0.1.5a
------
- Now you can run multiple pipelines (with or without subtasks) one after another, updating descriptions and lenghts.
